	- Every node to the left is less than its parent
	- Every node to the right is greater than equal to its parent


Binary Search Tree:
	- All nodes in the tree should hvae the BST property
	- BST should always have INERT, SEARCH, DELETE methods. 
	- Deletion is the hardest of the three.

Big O:
	- Average
		Time:  O(log(N))
		Space: O(log(N))

	- Worst: (If you have tree that has only branch, then you are going through the entire branch.)
		Time:  O(N)
		Space: O(N) -> only for recursive
			   O(1) -> only for iterative
