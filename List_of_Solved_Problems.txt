//DEFANG AN IP ADDRESS// (Easy)
Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address.
A defanged IP address replaces every period "." with "[.]".

Answer:
	Using the format of the IP address to our advantage.
	Each section in the IP address is 3-bits max. So look for 3 then 2 and then 1
	and move to the next section.

//REVERSE INTEGER// (Easy)
Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.
Note: Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

Answer:
	1    2    3 
	100  10   0

	300
 	 20
	+ 1
	---
	321

Challenges:
	You have to figure out the exponent part very carefully. 
	The exponent will have to -1 or else your answers will have on extra zeroth place on the right. 
	Second challenge was due to me not reading the question properly.

// Palindrome Number// (Easy)
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
Example 1:

Input: 121
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: -121
Output: false


Answer:
	Use the same strategy as the previous problem to reverse the integer.
	However in this case we ignore all the negative numbers. 
	Function doesn't have to check the 32 bit limit in this case. 
	Simply return a boolean

Challenge:
	Make sure the counter for the exponent decrement by one.

// Longest Substring Without Repeating Character//
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 

Example 2:
Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:
Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

Answer:
	There were many challenges about this problem. 
	Formulating the correct idea took a long time. (Had to change on it three times)
	Need to really focus on the edge cases for the problem. (Silly mistakes can cost you big time)
