LC: 298 - Binary Tree Longest Consecutive Sequence
Give the reference to a binary tree, return the length of the longest path in the tree
that contains consecutive values. 

Note: The path must move downward in the tree. 
Ex: Given the following binary tree...
1
 \
  2
   \
    3
return 3.

Ex: Given the following binary treeâ€¦

       1
      / \
     2   2
    / \ / \
   4  3 5  8
     /
    4
return 4.


T: O(n); S: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in tree.
