"""
"Count and Say problem" Write a code to do following:
n String to print
0 1
1 1 1
2 2 1
3 1 2 1 1
...
Base case: n = 0 print "1"
for n = 1, look at previous string and write number of times a digit is seen and the digit itself. In this case, digit 1 is seen 1 time in a row... so print "1 1"
for n = 2, digit 1 is seen two times in a row, so print "2 1"
for n = 3, digit 2 is seen 1 time and then digit 1 is seen 1 so print "1 2 1 1"
for n = 4 you will print "1 1 1 2 2 1"

Consider the numbers as integers for simplicity. e.g. if previous string is "10 1" then the next will be "1 10 1 1" and the next one will be "1 1 1 10 2 1"

# We can use memoization to make this faster when the number increases.
