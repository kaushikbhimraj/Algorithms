"""
On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at (0, 0) and faces north.  
The robot can receive one of three instructions:

"G": go straight 1 unit;
"L": turn 90 degrees to the left;
"R": turn 90 degress to the right.
The robot performs the instructions given in order, and repeats them forever.

Return true if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot 
never leaves the circle. 

Example 1:
Input: "GGLLGG"
Output: true
Explanation: 
The robot moves from (0,0) to (0,2), turns 180 degrees, and then returns to (0,0).
When repeating these instructions, the robot remains in the circle of radius 2 centered at the origin.

Example 2:
Input: "GG"
Output: false
Explanation: 
The robot moves north indefinitely.

Example 3:
Input: "GL"
Output: true
Explanation: 
The robot moves from (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (-1, 1) -> (-1, 0) -> (0, 0) -> ...

Note:
1 <= instructions.length <= 100
instructions[i] is in {'G', 'L', 'R'}
