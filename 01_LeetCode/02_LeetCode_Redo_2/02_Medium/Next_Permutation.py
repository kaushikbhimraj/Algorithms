Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next 
greater permutation of numbers. If such arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange 
it as the lowest possible order (i.e, sorted in ascending order). The replacement must 
be in-place and use only constant extra memory. Here are some examples. Inputs are in 
the left-hand column and its corresponding outputs are in the right-hand column.

1,2,3 â†’ 1,3,2
3,2,1 â†’ 1,2,3
1,1,5 â†’ 1,5,1

Time Complexity:  O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
