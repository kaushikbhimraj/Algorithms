"""
LOWEST COMMON MANAGER
You're given three inputs, all of which are instances of an OrgChart class that have a directReports property pointing to their direct reports. The first input is the top manager in an organizational chart (i,e., the only instance that isn't anybody else's direct report), and the other two inputs are reports in the organizational chart. 

Write a function that returns the lowest common manager to the two reports.
